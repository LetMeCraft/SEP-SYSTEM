          <strong>SepsisPredict</strong> is an AI-powered clinical decision support tool designed
          to help in the <span className="text-blue-600 font-semibold">early detection of sepsis</span> ‚Äî 
          a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body‚Äôs response to infection causes 
          organ dysfunction. Early identification is critical for timely medical intervention, 
          and SepsisPredict aims to support healthcare professionals and patients in this process.

            üå°Ô∏è How SepsisPredict Works

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-3 text-lg">
            <li>
              Users enter vital signs and lab values ‚Äî such as lactate level, heart rate, white
              blood cell count, and blood pressure.
            </li>
            <li>
              Our AI model analyzes these parameters and predicts the likelihood of sepsis using
              data patterns trained from medical datasets.
            </li>
            <li>
              The system provides a <strong>sepsis risk score</strong> (0‚Äì100%) and visual indicators to
              help users and doctors assess the severity.
            </li>
            <li>
              All predictions and previous assessments are stored securely in the patient‚Äôs
